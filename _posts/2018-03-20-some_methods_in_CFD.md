#Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian
In computational fluid dynamics, the Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian Method (SELM) is an approach to capture essential features of **fluid-structure** interactions subject to thermal fluctuations while introducing approximations which facilitate analysis and the development of tractable numerical methods. SELM is a hybrid approach utilizing an Eulerian description for the continuum hydrodynamic fields and a Lagrangian description for elastic structures. Thermal fluctuations are introduced through stochastic driving fields.
