#Note

Full unsteady ice accretion model was implemented by Aliaga.

##Rime ice
New model improves the accuracy of ice prediction, compared to quasi-steady approach.

##Glaze ice
This new model requires the implementation of local surface roughness and that previous quasi-steady validations cannot be carried out using a small number of shots.
